# ESP32 BLE Rover 🚗📡

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **ESP32-based rover controlled via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**.  
It highlights my skills in **embedded firmware development, motor driver control, and wireless communication protocols**.  

The rover responds to BLE commands (`F`, `B`, `L`, `R`, `S`) to move forward, backward, left, right, or stop.

## ⚙️ Hardware Used
- ESP32 DevKit
- Motor Driver (L298N / H-bridge)
- 4 DC motors
- Power supply (Li-ion battery pack)

---

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- **Embedded C++ (Arduino framework)** for motor control and BLE callbacks  
- **Protocol integration**: BLE communication for wireless control  
- **Hardware debugging**: GPIO pin mapping and motor driver interfacing  
- **IoT readiness**: Project structured for future MQTT/cloud logging integration
